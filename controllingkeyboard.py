                                             increase in Earth's average surface temperature, is primarily driven 
                                             by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, 
                                             and natural gas. These activities release significant amounts of greenhouse gases, 
                                             including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere. 
                                             These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect" that leads to a warming of 
                                             the planet. The consequences of global warming are profound and far-reaching. 
                                             They include more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods; 
                                             melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, which contribute to rising sea levels; and disruptions 
                                             to ecosystems and biodiversity. Additionally, global warming poses serious threats to human health,
                                             food security, water resources, and economic stability. The increased temperatures and changing 
                                             precipitation patterns can lead to crop failures, water shortages, and the spread of diseases. 
                                             Mitigating global warming requires concerted global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
                                             through the adoption of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency measures, reforestation, 
                                             and sustainable agricultural practices. It also necessitates international cooperation and 
                                             policy frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, to ensure that global temperature rise is                                           
                                             limited to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the 
                                             increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
